					<h1>Ideas - Design Lab</h1>
					<p>Design is experiential art.  It is a recognition of the relationship between human values and the various elements in the creative flux.  Good design is functional, sustainable, beautiful and enduring.  Grupo Pacific was founded on the notion that by encouraging our highly trained team of designers to think &ldquo;outside-of-the-box&rdquo;, we could achieve greater imaginative expression, cutting-edge design and spaces that stimulate and inspire.   Through a process of thought, research, modeling and interactive adjustment, we have provided our clients with cost effective solutions avoiding the trap of repetitive &ldquo;linear models&rdquo; that fail to get a broad perspective on design problems.  With a key understanding of the human experience, simple efficient design evolves.  Good design is not invented; rather it is a natural order of aesthetics, functionality, and economies of scale that we recognize from the surrounding world.</p><p>
Our forward leaning design philosophy is applied to a broad range of project types.  At Grupo Pacific we innovate good design in a variety of fields including corporate, residential, hospitality, industrial, institutional, medical and government facilities.  We also specialize in integrating strong marketing strategies and create &ldquo;brands-that-communicate&rdquo; for our clients.  Grupo Pacific provides our valued clientele with a wide range of branding, web design and graphic solutions from reinvigorating corporate logos and business cards to a comprehensive branding of interior spaces.  We are your &ldquo;one-stop&rdquo; crew for integrated design.</p><p>
With over 25 years of experience in the industry, the team at Grupo Pacific stands ready to provide solutions to all of your design challenges.</p>
